Pyfas - FA tools
===========

Pyfas is a python toolbox for flow assurance engineers.

At this moment in time the toolbox contains specific classes for tpl, ppl and tab files with dedicated methods and some minor utilities like the PI_read function.

While some python knowledge is required to really make use of all the functionalities, some pre-defined notebooks can be of help to execute single specific tasks (like dumping all the trends or profiles in an excel spreadsheet). For these notebooks no python knowledge is required.

These utilities have been written for OLGA (version > 6.X) tpl and ppl files but will be extended to Compas if and when something similar (output files)  will be available
