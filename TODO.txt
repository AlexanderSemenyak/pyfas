tpl.py  
should be more or less OK, still a bit of testing on the road is required
ppl.py
more or less ok, small things to fix: 
1. the pipeline filter search also in the header
2. the geometries must have a non staggered version
3. the extraction must have the geometry extraction before, now is quite boring

fixed issues for ppl

11 - 12 -2015
Added a lot of features and the tab class. Still ongoing.
For the tab class:
1. The "T" in the dataframe must be changed, it is confused with the T dataframe
method
2. data["properties"] has a white space at the beginning and at the the end that
has to be removed.
3. For the keyword files the data DataFrame has to be structured but at least
the extraction now works fine (the incredible execution time issue has been
fixed).

Solved all the issues above mentioned, the problem not is that the data
structures for keyword and fixed files is different. It must me armonized. The
keyword dataframe is easier to use.
