tpl.py  
should be more or less OK, still a bit of testing on the road is required
ppl.py
more or less ok, small things to fix: 
1. the pipeline filter search also in the header
2. the geometries must have a non staggered version
3. the extraction must have the geometry extraction before, now is quite boring
