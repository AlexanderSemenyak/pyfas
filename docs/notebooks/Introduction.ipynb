    "# Introduction to Pyfas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyfas is a python toolbox for flow assurance engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wrappers\n",
    "At this moment in time the toolbox contains wrappers for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* OLGA \n",
    "* Unisim Design\n",
    "* Gap (not yet available)\n",
    "* Pipesim (not yet available)\n",
    "* SFC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Olga** is the standard de facto for the dynamic simulations of multiphase\n",
    "systems (single pipelines or complex network) in the oil and gas indistry. The\n",
    "simulator has text input and output files; with pyfas you can expose Olga\n",
    "results to python (both trends and profiles) or dump all the results to excel/csv\n",
    "for your post-precessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**UnisimDesign** is mainly a process simulator but can be used also to simulate\n",
    "pipelines or networks in particular providing some external components.\n",
    "Differently from Olga Unisim (unfortunately) does not use text input or\n",
    "output files, the only way to communicate with the software is via a COM interface\n",
    "using pywin32.  Pyfas does not pretend to exposes all the possible\n",
    "functionalities of Unisim, only a very limited subset is available at the\n",
    "moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "* Surge volume calculation\n",
    "* PIRead functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tab files** are look-up tables with specific thermodynamic properties at\n",
    "given pressure and temperature intervals used for flash calculations by dynamic\n",
    "simulators. These files are generated by thermodynamic simulators (like\n",
    "PTVTsim) and it is good practice to have a look on this information *before*\n",
    "a dynamic simulation. With pyfas it is possible to generate 3d plots of all the\n",
    "properties and examine more in detail critical ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **surge volume calculation** utility returns the surge volume given a drain\n",
    "rate and a liquid flowrate time series. Not more than a simple discrete\n",
    "integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **PIRead** it is possible to retrieve PI values from a PI server.\n",
    "\n",
    "A live demo should be available here below (no installation required)\n",
